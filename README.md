What does this bot exactly do?
(Cannot wait? Test the bot right away!! https://dca-grid.herokuapp.com/)

This is a DCA_GRID hybrid bot that creates six grid bots whose volumes are scaled from top to bottom. Each bot has specific setting assigned to it by me according to my specific money and risk management algerithm. This bot aims to profit both from mini price movements(in 0.7% scale)in each grid bot and price upward movement from the mean price average.
Right now for better understanding of the mechanism you can check the code, test it your self with the url given above, or simply ask me. ;)

It is mainly an open source project which combines the best of the both worlds. dca and grid bots. The main idea is to manage the risk with dca while having the advantage of grid scalping. More information and documentation is on the way. Stay tuned!

The project is still in heavy testing. So use on your own risk.

How to use the webapp:

* Go to the URL above
* Enter you API information
* If you want to run and test the bot, just press run.
* If you want to clean up your unused and empty 3commas grid bots (for any purpose), click on clean up.
* If you want to close the bot you ran before, click on the close all botton.

Notes:
* Obviously the provided link to web app is a prototype version and is as a proof of concept. The full functioning web app will come soon... Please contact me via @blockchainophil on twitter/instagram/telegram if you have any questions or are interested to know more.
* Beast mode should be enabled in 3commas settings.
* Right now the test webapp only works with FTX EOS-PERP pair by default.
* For security reasons it doesn't yet save your credentials until the app is fully bug tested. So you have to enter your info each time.

In case you want to buy me a cup of coffe or anything: ;)
